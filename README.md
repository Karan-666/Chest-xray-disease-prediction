# chest-xray-disease-prediction

This is my machine learning model with image processing to predict if a person has covid-19, pneumonia, or is normal with 95% accuracy.
I made this model for my 7th-semester project in our college. The model is fused with a fully functional graphical user interface (GUI) made with 'streamlit' without using any backend HTML codes.
The X-ray dataset was downloaded from Kaggle.com and the model was saved using pickle.
The model was tested with deep learning methods like CNN as well, but I received better accuracy with SVM.
